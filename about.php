            An alumnus (masculine) or an alumna (feminine) of a college, university, or other school is a former student
            who has either attended or graduated in some fashion from the institution. The word is Latin and means "one
            who is being (or has been) nourished". The plural is alumni for men and mixed groups and alumnae for women.
            The term is not synonymous with "graduate"; one can be an alumnus without graduating (Burt Reynolds, alumnus
            but not graduate of Florida State, is an example). The term is sometimes used to refer to a former employee
            or member of an organization, contributor, or inmate.
